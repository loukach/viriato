# Viriato

Exploring Portuguese Parliament open data to prototype civic engagement tools.

## Goals

- Map parliamentary open data sources
- Prototype features to help citizens:
  - View Parliament's agenda
  - Understand when to influence elected deputies
  - Audit deputies' contributions vs their promises

## Project Status

**Phase**: Data Discovery
Currently mapping available datasets from [parlamento.pt open data portal](https://www.parlamento.pt/Cidadania/Paginas/DadosAbertos.aspx).

## Inspiration

Based on ideas from [adamastor](https://github.com/bcamarneiro/adamastor).

## Structure

```
viriato/
├── docs/              # Documentation of available datasets
├── data/
│   └── samples/       # Sample data files for reference
└── README.md
```

## Approach

Building in small, high-confidence steps. No code until we understand what data exists and what's actually useful.
