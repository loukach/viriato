# Viriato: Product Vision

> *"A democracia não é um espetáculo a que se assiste, é um processo em que se participa."*

---

## The Vision

**Portuguese citizens are actively engaged in their nation's course-setting, helping their representatives understand the people better.**

We envision a Portugal where:
- Citizens don't just vote every 4 years — they **participate continuously**
- Representatives don't just speak for the people — they **listen to the people**
- Democracy isn't a spectator sport — it's a **collaborative process**
- Political decisions aren't made in isolation — they're made **with informed public input**

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### The Democratic Disconnect

There's a growing chasm between Portuguese citizens and their elected representatives:

| Citizens feel... | Representatives face... |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Ignored between elections | Information overload |
| Unable to understand what's happening | No systematic way to gauge public opinion |
| Fooled by promises never kept | Pressure from organized lobbies, not citizens |
| Powerless to influence outcomes | Disconnect from everyday concerns |
| Governed by an out-of-touch political class | Voters who feel alienated |

**The result:** Low trust, low engagement, and a democracy that exists in name but not in practice.

### Why This Happens

1. **Information asymmetry** — Politicians know what's being discussed; citizens don't
2. **Complexity barrier** — Parliamentary processes are deliberately or accidentally opaque
3. **No feedback loop** — Citizens can't easily respond to what's being proposed
4. **Time poverty** — People have lives; they can't spend hours researching legislation
5. **Learned helplessness** — "My opinion doesn't matter anyway"

## Our Mission

**Make parliamentary activity accessible, understandable, and actionable for every Portuguese citizen.**

We believe that an informed citizenry is the foundation of a healthy democracy. When people understand what their representatives are doing, they can:
- Hold them accountable
- Provide meaningful input
- Make informed voting decisions
- Participate in public debate with facts, not just feelings

## The Viriato Approach

### Phase 1: Transparency (Current)
*"What is happening?"*

- Make parliamentary data accessible and searchable
- Translate bureaucratic language into plain Portuguese
- Visualize the legislative process
- Show who is doing what

**Status:** ✅ In progress

### Phase 2: Understanding (Next)
*"What does this mean for me?"*

- Personalized relevance ("initiatives that affect your profession/region/interests")
- Impact explanations ("if this passes, here's what changes")
- Historical context ("similar initiatives in the past led to...")
- Expert analysis integration

**Status:** 🔜 Planned

### Phase 3: Engagement (Future)
*"How can I participate?"*

- Comment on initiatives (public discourse)
- Signal support or opposition (citizen sentiment)
- Connect with others who share your concerns
- Direct communication channels to representatives
- Petition integration

**Status:** 📋 Vision

### Phase 4: Influence (Long-term)
*"My voice matters"*

- Representatives actively consult Viriato for citizen sentiment
- Public input shapes legislative priorities
- Transparent feedback: "X citizens expressed concern about Y, leading to amendment Z"
- Real-time democracy, not just election-day democracy

**Status:** 🌟 Dream

## Core Principles

### 1. Radical Transparency
Everything public should be publicly accessible. No paywalls. No registration barriers. No gatekeeping.

### 2. Political Neutrality
Viriato presents facts, not opinions. We don't tell citizens what to think — we give them the information to think for themselves.

### 3. Citizen-First Design
Every feature asks: "Does this help a regular citizen understand and engage?" If not, it doesn't belong.

### 4. Accessibility Over Completeness
Better to explain 80% clearly than 100% confusingly. Progressive disclosure: simple first, details on demand.

### 5. Open Source, Open Data
Democracy belongs to everyone. Our code and our processed data are public goods.

## Success Looks Like...

### Short-term (1 year)
- 10,000+ monthly active users
- Citizens can find and understand any initiative in under 1 minute
- Media outlets cite Viriato as a source
- At least one representative publicly acknowledges using Viriato

### Medium-term (3 years)
- Viriato is the default way Portuguese citizens check parliamentary activity
- Citizen sentiment data influences at least one legislative debate
- Integration with official parliament systems
- Educational institutions use Viriato to teach civics

### Long-term (10 years)
- Portugal is recognized internationally for citizen engagement in democracy
- The "Viriato model" is replicated in other countries
- A new generation grows up expecting transparency and participation as normal
- The phrase "out-of-touch politicians" becomes outdated

## Why "Viriato"?

Viriato was a legendary Lusitanian leader who united tribes against Roman occupation in the 2nd century BC. He represents:

- **Resistance** against distant, unaccountable power
- **Unity** of common people for a shared cause
- **Portuguese identity** rooted in self-determination
- **The underdog** who proved that organization beats resources

Today's challenge isn't a foreign army — it's alienation from our own democratic institutions. Viriato aims to help citizens reclaim their democracy, not through revolution, but through **information, understanding, and participation**.

---

## The Invitation

Democracy is not a gift from politicians to citizens. It's a responsibility we share.

Viriato is an invitation:
- To politicians: **Be seen. Be understood. Be accountable.**
- To citizens: **Pay attention. Understand. Participate.**
- To Portugal: **Let's build a democracy worthy of the name.**
