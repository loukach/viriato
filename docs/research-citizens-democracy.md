## Executive Summary

Democratic systems worldwide face a crisis of engagement and trust. Portugal is no exception—with only 31% trusting parliament and abstention rates that reached 51% in 2022. This research synthesizes findings from OECD surveys, academic studies, and civic tech evaluations to understand why citizens feel disconnected and what works to re-engage them.

## Part 1: The Trust Crisis

### Portugal-Specific Data (OECD 2024)

| Institution | Trust Level | OECD Average |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Police | 65% | - |
| Other people | 57% | - |
| Courts/judicial system | 45% | - |
| National civil service | 43% | - |
| News media | 39% | - |
| Central government | 32% | 39% |
| **National parliament** | **31%** | - |
| **Political parties** | **18%** | - |

**Key finding:** Political parties and parliament are the **least trusted** institutions in Portugal.

### Trust Decline Over Time

- Portugal's trust in central government **dropped 9 percentage points** between 2021-2023
- This is nearly 4x the OECD average decline (2.4 points)
- Between 2019-2024, Portugal experienced declines in Representation, Rights, and Rule of Law

## Part 2: Voter Abstention in Portugal

### Historical Trend

| Year | Turnout | Abstention |
|------|---------|------------|
| 1975 | 91.5% | 8.5% |
| 2019 | ~49% | ~51% |
| 2022 | 51.4% | 48.6% |
| 2024 | 66.2% | 33.8% |

**The 2024 election saw the lowest abstention since 1995** - possibly due to political polarization driving engagement.

### Who Doesn't Vote?

1. **Young people** - Only 47% of Portuguese youth (18-24) reported voting
2. **Lower education** - Unique to Portugal: lower education correlates with higher abstention
3. **Unequal regions** - Highest abstention in regions with highest inequality
4. **Emigrants** - ~1 million registered voters live abroad (inflates abstention statistics)

### European Context

In 2019 European elections, Portugal recorded **68.6% abstention** - highest since joining the EU, contrasting with ~50% average across Europe.

## Part 3: Why Citizens Disengage

### 1. Feeling Unheard

> "Large majorities in many nations believe elected officials don't care what people like them think."

- Citizens perceive decisions are made without their input
- No systematic feedback loop between citizens and representatives
- Perception that involvement has "little to no effect on governmental decisions"

> Source: [Pew Research - Trust and Distrust in America](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/07/22/trust-and-distrust-in-america/)

### 2. Broken Promises

> "Campaign promises are a central mechanism for voters to hold politicians accountable... candidates who fulfill their promises are perceived as more credible, trustworthy, and accountable."

- Politicians make promises they fail to fulfill
- 85% of Americans believe government is "wasteful" (up 15 points from 2022)
- 74% believe it is corrupt

> Source: [Partnership for Public Service - State of Public Trust 2025](https://ourpublicservice.org/publications/the-state-of-public-trust-in-government-2025/)

### 3. Economic Disconnect

> "The cost-of-living crisis not only negatively affects economic well-being, but also chips away at broader belief that governing bodies have the ability—or even the intention—to act in citizens' best interests."

- Economic struggles fuel distrust
- 64% across 34 countries said their national economy was in "bad shape" (2024)
- Low-income families and rural communities feel "neglected"

> Source: [Eurofound - Trust in Crisis](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/en/commentary-and-analysis/all-content/trust-crisis-europes-social-contract-under-threat)

### 4. Complexity and Opacity

> "Not everyone has the ability to understand political processes and legal technicalities when no effort is made to explain these to citizens."

- Parliamentary language is exclusionary
- Information buried in PDFs, complex interfaces
- No clear explanation of how citizen input affects outcomes

> Source: [Institut Montaigne - Participatory Democracy](https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/expressions/participatory-democracy-importance-having-say-when-times-are-hard)

### 5. The "Out of Touch" Political Class

> "We live in an age of fantasy disconnected from the everyday experience of people... Western politics is being consumed by technocrats and populists who inhabit a world of fiction."

- Populist parties capitalize on "voters' frustrations with elites"
- Belief that establishment parties are "out of touch with ordinary citizens"
- Perceived self-interest of political class

> Source: [CEPR - Political Distrust and the Populist Alt-View Trap](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/political-distrust-and-populist-alt-view-trap)

### 6. Youth-Specific Issues

> "Only 13% of voting-age Gen Z have 'a great deal' or 'quite a lot' of trust in the presidency."

Key factors for young people:
- **Misinformation** - Hard to filter meaningful content from noise
- **Lack of civic education** - Only 4% can correctly answer basic civics questions
- **Economic struggles** - 40%+ find it difficult to meet basic needs
- **Feeling "politically homeless"** - Less than 1 in 4 feel they belong to a political group
- **Not targeted** - 48% of youth without college experience were never contacted about elections

## Part 4: What Works - Civic Tech Success Stories

### TheyWorkForYou (UK) - Key Learnings

**Background:** Running for 20+ years, makes UK Parliament accessible and searchable.

**Proven Impact:**
- Parliamentarians changed behavior - more votes, more independence from party
- Representatives now publicly explain their votes
- 2% of visits from Parliament IP addresses (MPs use it themselves)
- Half of users are regulars; 20% use it monthly
- Won Community and Innovation award (2005)

**Challenges:**
- MPs "gaming" statistics by tabling forgettable questions
- Quantitative measures may miss qualitative contributions
- Need to adapt as behavior changes

**International Replication:** Code adapted for New Zealand, Ireland, Australia, Kenya, Ghana, South Africa, Nigeria, Zimbabwe.

## Part 5: Structural Solutions Proposed by Experts

### Transparency Requirements

> "Policy-makers must show transparency by being clear about how citizen input can and will be used, and feeding back results."

- Open data standards for parliamentary information
- Real-time publication of votes, debates, documents
- Clear communication about decision rationale

> Source: [Open Government Partnership - Open Parliaments](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/policy-area/open-parliaments/)

### Citizens' Assemblies

> "Citizens' assemblies have tackled a range of issues. The environment has been the most popular, addressed by 16 assemblies so far."

- Randomly selected citizens deliberate on complex issues
- Provides legitimacy and public buy-in
- Addresses feeling of being "unheard"

> Source: [IWM - Citizens' Assemblies](https://www.iwm.at/europes-futures/publication/citizens-assemblies-democratic-responses-to-authoritarian-challenges)

### Civic Education

> "Young people are rarely taught how systems work, how to engage with them, or why their voice matters."

- Integrate civic education into schools
- Explain not just mechanics but "why it matters"
- Use digital tools to make learning engaging

> Source: [Freedom House - Why Are Youth Dissatisfied with Democracy?](https://freedomhouse.org/article/why-are-youth-dissatisfied-democracy)

### Electoral and Institutional Reform

Proposed by [Electoral Reform Society](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/latest-news-and-research/publications/close-the-gap/):
- Proportional voting systems
- Getting money out of politics
- More responsive representation structures

## Part 6: Implications for Viriato

### Validated Pain Points

Our [citizen-pain-points.md](./citizen-pain-points.md) is strongly supported by research:

| Our Pain Point | Research Validation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Information hard to find | 48-68% unaware of alternative ways to access parliament info |
| Process incomprehensible | Complexity cited as major barrier across studies |
| Can't track what matters | No systematic way for citizens to follow topics |
| Don't know how MP voted | TheyWorkForYou proved massive demand for this |
| No big picture view | Citizens lack ability to see patterns |
| Jargon alienating | Explicitly cited as exclusion mechanism |
| Not timely | No proactive communication to citizens |
| Not mobile-friendly | Digital divide excludes many |
| "Nothing changes" feeling | Confusion about what types of initiatives actually matter |

### High-Impact Features to Prioritize

Based on TheyWorkForYou's success and research findings:

1. **Voting records** - Proven to change MP behavior
2. **Topic tracking** - Address "can't follow what matters to me"
3. **Plain language** - Critical for inclusion
4. **Mobile-first** - Essential for broad reach
5. **Impact indicators** - Help citizens understand what actually matters
6. **Alerts/subscriptions** - Proactive engagement

### Risks to Monitor

- **Gaming** - Representatives may try to manipulate metrics
- **Quantitative bias** - Don't reduce representation to numbers
- **Digital divide** - Not everyone has smartphones/internet
- **Political neutrality** - Must remain non-partisan to maintain trust
